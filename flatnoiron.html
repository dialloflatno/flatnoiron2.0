<h1>Why Phones?</h1>
<p id="flaPhone"> We focus on phones mainly because it's one of our main sources of communication today.
Communication has changed tremendously throughout time. We believe that its evolution is endless and
has much greater potential in-store.  Technology has evolved in a short period, which has most of us still trying to figure out how to use the phone we be two years ago.
